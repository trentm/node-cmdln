# 2.1?

- support for sub-subcommands
- bash completion generation support
- docs: see below


# bash completion

Some thoughts. See `npm completion` for some inspiration.

- Having dashdash option types of 'path', 'file', 'dir' that were basically just
  completion type annotations on regular 'str' might be helpful.
- Need/want type annotations on the args. Then node-manta would want to provide
  special completion handling for "mantaPath" type.
- Ultimately want a fallback to custom control via a `Cmdln.do_foo.completion`.
- dashdash itself should provide option completion to support bash completion
  simple commands


# other

- doc helpOpts, helpBody, etc.
- tests and docs for _ -> - translation in sub-command names
- doc `init` usage (--version example). Doc `this.opts` for global parsed
  opts.
- doc `return callback(false)` ?
- update README for current usage
- make do_help optional (see helpCmd in ctor)
- `debug: true` option to  ctor for the debug logging
- test with imgadm, imgapi-cli

# someday/maybe

- bash completion generation support
- interactive shell (a la cmdln.py)
